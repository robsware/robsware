        <h1>Burp labs week 5: Keeping busy and a screeching halt</h1>
        <p>Posted on May 31, 2020 <br><br>
        Busy week, so busy. And with what? I don't know! Such is the life of an adult. And to top it all off, a new section of labs has been introduced to burp, Authentication labs. Regardless, some progress has still been made:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <span class="center"><img src="burpweek5.png" alt="Week 5" /></span><br><br>
        <p>Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the labs are in a limbo state where if you complete a lab it doesn't get marked as complete in the progress tracker. Which kinda prompted me to stop for now until the problem is fixed. I still did a few more labs that I'll have to redo once the labs become fully functional again. I also pinged them on Twitter about it.
        <br><br>
        The problem is that I cleared up my day to focus on the labs and now I've been left with an empty time frame in there that's not big enough to attempt even a small project but too big to just fill with videogames. I suppose I can hit HackTheBox, but I've been reluctant towards getting back into it without a serious commitment due to how their experience system works. I might do some clean-up in an older project though or rice my distro a bit. I could also start the overall Burp labs experience writeup. Or I could just catch up on some books.

        Decisions, decisions.
