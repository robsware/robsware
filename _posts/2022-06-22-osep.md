I have successfully cleared the OSEP exam in April on my 2nd attempt with 15 flags and secret.txt. I have some mixed feelings about the whole experience so I will try to put those thoughts in writing in this post.

**The platform**

I finally got an OSEP voucher in late November, after OffSec had already deployed their new learning platform. After I got used to the UI, I wanted to start going through the course and that is the point where the problems began. 

First issue reared its ugly head here. The course was only viewable on the OffSec learn platform, generally about one page at a time. Trying to move on to another page would cause the system to render it again, which could take anywhere from 5 seconds to 30 seconds or it would outright crash. This isn’t great when you’re quickly flicking through material when trying to solve a lab. Not to mention the platform has no CTRL+F functionality so you better remember where everything is. There is also an input box with notes for each page, for some bizarre reason. You can no longer access the reading material once your lab time expires, making the notes moot. The top of the page kept saying that the PDF and video download are being generated for weeks. I kept emailing help@offsec to ask if they could send me a link to download the pdf and video locally, and they kept saying I should receive a link automatically in my inbox. Which I did, 3 weeks later. 

**The content**

This one is actually really good, and by far the best part of the course. The PDF is thorough and explains things very well, although it goes weirdly in depth in some topics that aren’t very relevant and then skimps on some much more important topics, such as kerberos. Some of the examples in the PDF also assume that you’re also watching the videos at the same time and may use examples from them. Personally, I find video an awful way of learning content so I tend to skip them or watch them on fast forward to get the idea. Personally, I could’ve used a bit more details on how the lab works, such as the fact that the IPs used in the PDF/videos are the same as the IPs you get, except for the third octet, but that might just be me not paying enough attention. 

However, to admit that the content from the PDF prepares you to pass the exam is a stretch at best. Most of the content present in the exam can be found in the PDF, but the exam raises the stakes, size and difficulty substantially. Take what you get from the PDF as a starting point and seek outside sources to improve and build on your knowledge. 

As a whole, the PDF is still one of the best concentrated resources of knowledge when it comes to pentesting out there, and earns my full recommendation.

**The labs**

The borderline alpha state of the platform made its presence felt again here. The uptime for the labs was not good at all. There were frequent days, especially in my first month, where labs wouldn’t boot at all for multiple hours and I’d just get a generic error message. Offsec would just say something about how “they’re working on it” on the dedicated support channel for OSEP and nothing else. On other days when the labs worked, they often happened to be incredibly slow. This got worse as I progressed further into the lab, to the point where the final challenge labs were moving at a crawl’s pace. And lastly, some other times the functions to reset/stop a lab would also glitch out. Overall, I’d say I got about 50-60% of proper uptime during my time in the lab, which is disastrous by any metric. There was also very little communication from OffSec in regards to the performance of the labs. Which does bring me to my next point.

**The discord**

OffSec runs their own discord server which you can find by googling it. The server manages to strike a balance between being both overly moderated and too lax at the same time. Any mention whatsoever of course material or exam outside their specific channel is highly moderated and discouraged. If you want to discuss exercises or labs, you have to be manually verified by an OffSec staff member (your OSID and email) and then you’ll be granted access to those specific channels. Which does help a lot in keeping most complaints contained and hidden out of view. Many users, including myself, also feel a bit uneasy about sending OffSec your personally identifiable information over discord, but that is the only way. 

Some staff was basically “it works on my machine, good luck fam lmao”

It took me about 8 weeks to finish the PDF and the labs, not in small part thanks to the low activity at work around Christmas time.
